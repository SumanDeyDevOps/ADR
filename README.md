Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

ADR-1: Database Selection for InfoTech Application

Context
InfoTech Application is a web application designed to manage user-generated content, including text, images. The application must support high scalability, strong consistency, and efficient querying of relational data. The development team needs to choose a suitable database solution to meet these requirements.

Decision
Based on having different databases advantages and disadvantages, our team decided to proceed with MySQL as the primary database for the application.

The alternatives which were considered are mentioned below.
1. PostgreSQL
Pros: Better support for JSON data, advanced indexing capabilities.
Cons: Higher complexity in setup and tuning, slower write performance in some cases.

2. MongoDB
Pros: Flexible schema, optimized for document-based storage.
Cons: Requires additional handling for complex relational queries.

Rationale behind MySQL database selection:
1. MySQL is widely adopted and has a large community, making it easier to find resources and support
2. MySQL is optimized for read-heavy applications, which aligns with InfoTech's requirements
3. It offers replication and clustering options, supporting scalability needs
4. MySQL is well-supported in cloud environments (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure Database for MySQL)

Some Consequences:
1. Developers must ensure proper indexing and query optimization to maintain performance at scale
2. While MySQL supports horizontal scaling with read replicas, handling high write loads may require additional architectural decisions (e.g., sharding)
